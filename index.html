            <p>I often find myself revisiting the images I took in Bryce Canyon as I think about the future I want to have. Transitioning from being a professional musician and teacher into the tech world means giving many of the things I love the most a pause, or moving them to the backseat. But I also see the opportunities to spend more time with other passions, like logical problem solving, working with visual artists (ie UX designers), and the chance to see real projects through from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>I began learning web develoment in August 2020, and spent my first month working through Frontend Masters free Frontend Bootcamp. I learned a considerable amount, but I could already tell that was just the beginning. I began taking courses on algorithms and advanced Javascript, and, at the recommendation of a friend, I began learning the React framework, which has become both my nemesis and my motivation to keep learning. As you can probably tell from this page, creative UX design is not my strength, but I enjoy implementing the designs of other, more artistically-minded creators. My goals in this internship are to strengthen my understanding of React (including a more complete knowledge of API handling), to continue working on my data structures knowledge, and to begin working with topics like user authentication and full suite testing.</p>
